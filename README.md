# Simple ToDo Application 


1. The application is using elasticsearch for search, so make sure that's [installed](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick) and running or else it won't work. Running brew install elasticsearch from the command line should do the trick. 
2. From there do the typical rake db:create db:migrate and rails s, then have fun creating a small todo list. 
3. Happy coding
